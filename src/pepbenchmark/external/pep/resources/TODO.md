## Monomer library

Currently, `monomers.sdf`, `natural_monomers.sdf`, `non-natural_monomers.sdf` and `cap_monomers.sdf` are all processed from `HELMCoreLibrary.sdf`, which is downloaded from [HELMMonomerSets](https://github.com/PistoiaHELM/HELMMonomerSets/tree/master). This monomer library is good for current use. However, there are following more options for monomer library.

1. HELM Core Library 2.0 from [HELMMonomerSets](https://github.com/PistoiaHELM/HELMMonomerSets/tree/master)
2. Monomer library from ChEMBL [chembl_35_monomer_library.xml](https://ftp.ebi.ac.uk/pub/databases/chembl/ChEMBLdb/releases/chembl_35/)
3. Java code for parse and export HELM monomers and notations from [HELM2NotationToolkit](https://github.com/PistoiaHELM/HELM2NotationToolkit/tree/master)
